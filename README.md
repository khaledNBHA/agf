# Axiomatic Gravity Framework (AGF)

This repository provides the official implementation of the **Axiomatic Gravity Framework**, a Riemannian approach to epistemic persistence in autonomous systems.

## Overview
AGF transitions from linguistic guardrails to a **topological foundation** for AI safety. By modeling foundational certainty (*Yaqin*) as gravitational singularities on an information manifold, we ensure structural resilience against high-entropy perturbations (*Shakk*).

## Key Components
1. **Riemannian Attention Mechanism (RAM)**: Anchors latent states to axiomatic wells using metric-gated weights.
2. **Object-Proof Consensus (OPC)**: Logic for decentralized axiomatic mass calculation (simulated).
3. **Metric-Gated Optimizer**: A custom optimizer that dissipates gradients failing to reach escape velocity $M_A$.

## Quick Start
```python
from agf_core import RiemannianAttention

# Initialize the anchor
ram_layer = RiemannianAttention(d_model=128, beta=2.5)

# Forward pass with safety persistence
safe_latent = ram_layer(input_latent)

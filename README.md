# Axiomatic Gravity Framework (AGF) - Official Implementation

This repository contains the source code for the paper:  
**"Axiomatic Gravity: Riemannian Geometry as a Foundation for Epistemic Persistence in Autonomous Systems"** *Submitted to IEEE WCCI 2026 (IJCNN).*

## 📌 Abstract
AGF introduces a topological foundation for AI safety. By modeling foundational constraints as gravitational wells on a Riemannian manifold, we prevent "Epistemic Drift" (Shakk) in autonomous agents under extreme uncertainty.
